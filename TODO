  ...13 June 2018: Let's play for a few hours, and if we don't see this again assume it's OK.

Windows errors:
- Freeze on startup, Windows:
  MSAUDIO:TRACE: ps_msaudio_init [src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:89]
- Toggling out of fullscreen, other windows don't repaint
- Soft render scaling borked (see penguin shadow).
- Boxingglove struts sometimes go all-black when retracted... doesn't happen with GX render

MacOS errors:

Actionable:
- Establish and enforce difficulty standards (eg die-cross-heal should be like 5 or 6 minimum).
- Remove return switches if they might be used to cheat challenges.

Windows:
- Build with GL2 support
- src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:6://TODO Need a mutex to protect callback
- src/opt/mshid/ps_mshid_global.c:186:     * TODO Signed values in MS HID input. (tricky!)

- src/opt/mswm/ps_mswm_graphics.c:25:  //TODO Assert OpenGL features.
- Configurable audio buffer size?

MacOS:
- Developer license

Linux:

Raspi:

Optimization, cleanup, low priority:
- Store background image to texture
- ps_sdraw_draw_line(): Optimize writes
- sdraw: optimize blits
- Clean up logging
- src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:117:  int buffer_size=8192; // bytes (TODO optimal size?)
- Review stubs in akgl_soft_shaders.c
- Remove scenario encoding (it's already disabled)

Ongoing, loosely-defined items:
- Review dragoncharger with multiple real players.
- src/video/ps_image_decode.c:242:  /* TODO Image filter: Either improve it or take it out.
- Review award assignment with realistic data
- Goal: 200 blueprints
- Finish sound effects
- Finish music
- Goal: 100 sprdefs
- More background graphics

Optional:
- src/input/ps_input_report_reader.h:3: * TODO We don't support collection fields, like for HID keyboards. Should we? Our focus is joysticks.

Blocked:
- Full review of data
- Documentation
- Promo
- Final packaging
- Normalize sound effects and music
- Steam licensing
- Other app stores?

Rejected:
- Scissor for sdraw blits. Only needed by editor.
  sdraw is already a performance problem. Don't make it any worse, just for the editor's sake.
- Input swap: Should we enable this for production use?
  No. Too complicated.
- src/scenario/ps_scgen.c:844:ps_scgen_count_unassigned_regions: * TODO Our use of (visited) is not perfect, it will give bad counts if there is a loop.
  No harm, not worth the trouble.
- src/gui/editor/ps_widget_sfxchan.c:300:  //TODO coordinate graph value limits with button in channel widget
  It's working, whatever.
- Editor: new sound effect does nothing.
  Whatever, easy to work around by copying existing resource.
- Bomber multiexplode on heal point
  I can't reproduce this except by tapping button repeatedly
- Revisit scenario encoding, make it work, add UI to support it
  No longer interested in encoded scenario, not worth it.
- Should we pause or something when window loses focus?
  No. That's not our responsibility.
