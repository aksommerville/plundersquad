  ...investigated, can't reproduce
- Boxingglove should be nonhazardous when disabled.
- blueprint:113: not always enough room to guide mimic
- blueprint:50: yak appeared in water
- Heart should stop when flung into a small obstruction. Instead tends to push its way past.
- Does seamonster always face towards center? sometimes we need him looking out, towards the hero.
- Deathgate reappeared and seamonsters (statically placed) alive again after deed set:

Linux errors:

Windows errors:
- Freeze on startup, Windows:
  MSAUDIO:TRACE: ps_msaudio_init [src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:89]
- Toggling out of fullscreen, other windows don't repaint
    ...This is not happening anymore on my Windows 10 box.
- Input focus lost after switching window in fullscreen, I'm not sure what happened.

MacOS errors:

Actionable:
- Establish and enforce difficulty standards (eg die-cross-heal should be like 5 or 6 minimum).
- Remove return switches if they might be used to cheat challenges.
- Retrofit challenges with PS_PERMASWITCH_EXIT_AWAYWARD where applicable.
- Full review of data
- Documentation
- Promo
- Steam licensing
- Other app stores?
- Build into a Pi-based arcade console. See http://www.ultimarc.com/
  ...Build the electronics first, then get a membership at Idea Foundry to build it.
  ...And as far as that goes, prototype a single player's inputs before spending the full $300 or so on parts.

Windows:
- src/opt/mshid/ps_mshid_global.c:186:     * TODO Signed values in MS HID input. (tricky!)
- src/opt/mswm/ps_mswm_graphics.c:25:  //TODO Assert OpenGL features.
- Configurable audio buffer size?
- Try GL2 build on craptop and work laptop. ... no and yes

MacOS:
- Developer license
- Sign code
- Screen saver?

Linux:

Raspi:
- Confirm launching via X11.

Optimization, cleanup, low priority:
- ps_sdraw_draw_line(): Optimize writes
- sdraw: optimize blits
- Clean up logging
- src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:117:  int buffer_size=8192; // bytes (TODO optimal size?)
- Review stubs in akgl_soft_shaders.c
- Remove scenario encoding (it's already disabled)

Ongoing, loosely-defined items:
- Review dragoncharger with multiple real players.
- src/video/ps_image_decode.c:242:  /* TODO Image filter: Either improve it or take it out.
- Review award assignment with realistic data
- Finish sound effects
- Finish music
- More background graphics

Optional:
- src/input/ps_input_report_reader.h:3: * TODO We don't support collection fields, like for HID keyboards. Should we? Our focus is joysticks.

Blocked:
- Final packaging
- Normalize sound effects and music

Rejected:
- Scissor for sdraw blits. Only needed by editor.
  sdraw is already a performance problem. Don't make it any worse, just for the editor's sake.
- Input swap: Should we enable this for production use?
  No. Too complicated.
- src/scenario/ps_scgen.c:844:ps_scgen_count_unassigned_regions: * TODO Our use of (visited) is not perfect, it will give bad counts if there is a loop.
  No harm, not worth the trouble.
- src/gui/editor/ps_widget_sfxchan.c:300:  //TODO coordinate graph value limits with button in channel widget
  It's working, whatever.
- Editor: new sound effect does nothing.
  Whatever, easy to work around by copying existing resource.
- Bomber multiexplode on heal point
  I can't reproduce this except by tapping button repeatedly
- Revisit scenario encoding, make it work, add UI to support it
  No longer interested in encoded scenario, not worth it.
- Should we pause or something when window loses focus?
  No. That's not our responsibility.
- After first setup for Xbox 360 joystick, right thumbstick is sending A and B. Why?
  I did some other work in new evdev device after this, and it doesn't seem to happen anymore.
- !!! segfault collecting treasure (GLX, strawberry, 2/5) !!!
  ...update: it's not the strawberry
  ...13 June 2018: Let's play for a few hours, and if we don't see this again assume it's OK.
  ...23 June 2018: Fixed a separate concurrency problem in AKAU, and I don't expect to see this again.
- Store background image to texture
  No point.
- Goal: 100 sprdefs
  Not going to reach this, and that's OK.
- src/opt/mswm/ps_mswm_event.c:105:    //TODO We receive WM_SIZE when the resize is complete. Can we get it on the fly too?
  ...I can get WM_SIZE live, but can't figure out how to repaint without Windows blacking it out right after. I give up.
- Window doesn't have the usual orange border in Windows 10
  ...I think it's not supposed to, after some googling
- Exit-awayward permaswitch didn't pick up... went back and forth again, then it did. ? (174, swordsman and witch)
  ...in retrospect, it's possible that one sprite was dead the first time.
