Optimization, cleanup, low priority:
- Store background image to texture
- ps_sdraw_draw_line(): Optimize writes
- sdraw: optimize blits
- Clean up logging
- src/opt/msaudio/ps_msaudio.c:117:  int buffer_size=8192; // bytes (TODO optimal size?)
- Review stubs in akgl_soft_shaders.c

Ongoing, loosely-defined items:
- Review dragoncharger with multiple real players.
- src/video/ps_image_decode.c:242:  /* TODO Image filter: Either improve it or take it out.
- Revisit scenario encoding, make it work, add UI to support it
- Review award assignment with realistic data
- Should we pause or something when window loses focus?
- Goal: 200 blueprints

Optional:
- Final boss?
- src/input/ps_input_report_reader.h:3: * TODO We don't support collection fields, like for HID keyboards. Should we? Our focus is joysticks.

Blocked:
- Full review of data
- Documentation
- Promo
- Final packaging

Rejected:
- Scissor for sdraw blits. Only needed by editor.
  sdraw is already a performance problem. Don't make it any worse, just for the editor's sake.
- Input swap: Should we enable this for production use?
  No. Too complicated.
- src/scenario/ps_scgen.c:844: * TODO Our use of (visited) is not perfect, it will give bad counts if there is a loop.
  No harm, not worth the trouble.
- src/gui/editor/ps_widget_sfxchan.c:300:  //TODO coordinate graph value limits with button in channel widget
  It's working, whatever.
