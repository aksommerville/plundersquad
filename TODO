- More projectile-throwing monsters.
- Binary formats for all resources.
- Review dragoncharger with multiple real players.
- Final boss?
- Windows backend
- Record top scores
- !!! segfault collecting treasure (GLX, strawberry, 2/5) !!!
  ...update: it's not the strawberry
- Archer became unable to fire...? After "return to beginning". General input still OK.
  ...update: Not restricted to archer.
  ...Definitely "return to beginning is involved"
  ...Swapping input in the cheat menu cleared it up.
  ...Look at input restrictions, I know the menus do something here
- Investigate image filtering -- Observed much smaller output WITHOUT filter, that doesn't seem right.
- Data archive. I think we need to merge the AKAU resources and eliminate AKAU's own store.
