Analysis of data collected via test_rendering_performance.c.

SUMMARY

We can carry on confidently with the existing rendering model.
No sense wasting a lot of time on further optimization.

There are two outliers:
- Linux/GX has an invalid result due to missing low-sprite-count sample.
  It doesn't really matter; we know it's wicked fast.
- Pi/Soft is considerably slower than any other configuration.
  That won't even be an option in the final product though.

I consider worst-case scenario to be about 100 sprites.
Even the sluggish Pi should be able to draw those in about 336 us with GX.
My Windows box might take over 7 ms to render a 100-sprite scene.
That's bad, but I think we can still manage 60 Hz output with it.

My Linux and Mac boxes both rolled up this test and smoked it, with or without GX.
Using GX is a good idea, though. You can still see a pronounced difference.

METHODOLOGY

Raw test results are recorded in comments at the top of test_rendering_performance.c.
To estimate the per-sprite cost, take average performance for the lowest and highest sprite counts,
subtract one from the other, and average from there.
This will yield "AVERAGE", roughly the time in nanoseconds to render one "maxtile" sprite.
Consider the lowest count to be an estimate of the grid and other overhead.
Most of the accelerated scenarios yield such small numbers that I don't think those results are meaningful.

TODO

- Rerun Linux with GX; I didn't record a low count the first time.
