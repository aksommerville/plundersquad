Pi failed to launch. Last thing in the log was input detection -- 4 devices showed up but 6 were physically connected.
Switched to Mac, things looked OK but slightly overscanned on the Hisense TV.
Input config was a big confusion. Hard to tell which device was which. I don't know what we can do about this.
B-to-swap was a complete disaster, I shouldn't have left that enabled.
At one point, with 6 of us, we were unable to change screen mysteriously.
Second run with just Andy, Tana, Hayden. Agreed not to use B-to-swap.
After some manual healing, ghosts ended up solid.
One ghost ended up stuck in water.
